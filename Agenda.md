## Meeting Agenda

# QoS & TE for Differentiated Deterministic service

A side meeting at IETF 118

Time: MONDAY 6 November-17：30~19：00

Location: Palmovka 1/2

The enhanced DetNet has been proposed since July 2022 and enhanced data plane requirements and queuing solutions are currently 
being discussed in DetNet WG. Furthermore, enhanced DetNet should also support the new requirements to achieve enhanced network
performance and efficiency and promote the deployment such as different levels of applications co-existed with differentiated 
SLAs and high utilization of network resources. This will inevitably lead to consideration about differentiated QoS model and
the QoS-related treatments and behaviors. It also impacts the TE solutions including per-class or aggregate TE, time-based 
resource scheduling in scaling networks. This side meeting is initiated to have broad discussions and identify the chief 
concerns, disagreements and consensus of the IETF DetNet and TEAS community. 

The primary agenda is shown as below.
1, Note well, welcome statements, introduction and agenda bash. 5mins (Daniel Huang)

2, QoS & TE for Enhanced DetNet use cases:
*Enhanced Use cases and Classification of Applications for  Differentiated Services. Presenter: Junfeng Zhao (CAICT). 10mins

*Deterministic QoS Consideration for Enhanced DetNet. Presenter: Peng Liu(China Mobile). 10mins

*Requirements and Solution of Scaling Deterministic Networking Capability as a Service. Presenter: Jie Liang(China Telecom). 10mins

3, Problems, gap analysis and requirements:
*CATS & DetNet TE Requirements. Presenter: Adrian Farrel (Old Dog). 10mins

*Gap Analysis for DetNet QoS and TE. Presenter: Aihua Liu (ZTE).10mins

4, Solution consideration:
*Differentiated DetNet-aware QoS and TE. Quan Xiong (ZTE), 10mins.

5, Open discussions 15mins
*DetNet TE with time-based resources, what could be extended?
*Is the existing QoS enough for the diversified and differentiated deterministic service ?
