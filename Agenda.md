The enhanced DetNet has been proposed since July 2022 and enhanced data plane requirements and queuing solutions are currently 
being discussed in DetNet WG. Furthermore, enhanced DetNet should also support the new requirements to achieve enhanced network
performance and efficiency and promote the deployment such as different levels of applications co-existed with differentiated 
SLAs and high utilization of network resources. This will inevitably lead to consideration about differentiated QoS model and
the QoS-related treatments and behaviors. It also impacts the TE solutions including per-class or aggregate TE, time-based 
resource scheduling in scaling networks. This side meeting is initiated to have broad discussions and identify the chief 
concerns, disagreements and consensus of the IETF DetNet and TEAS community. 

The side meeting mainly focus on the enhanced use cases, problems, gap analysis, requirements and solution consideration of QoS & TE for differentiated deterministic services. 

The primary agenda is shown as below.

6. 18:15-18:25 Requirements and solution of scaling deterministic networking capability as a service. Presenter: Chanchan Huang(China Telecom). 10mins

7. 18:25-18:40 Solution consideration about differentiated DetNet-aware QoS and TE. Quan Xiong (ZTE). 15mins.

8. 18:40-17:00 Open discussions. Daniel Huang.20mins

*DetNet TE with time-based resources, what could be extended?

*Is the existing QoS enough for the diversified and differentiated deterministic service ?
