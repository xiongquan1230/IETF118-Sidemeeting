IETF 118 Sidemeeting Minutes-QoS & TE for Differentiated Deterministic services.

MONDAY, 6 November 2023, 17：30~19：00 (Prague)

1,Note well, welcome statements, introduction and agenda bash. Daniel Huang. 5mins

No bashing.

2,Traffic Engineering in CATS and DetNet. Presenter: Adrian Farrel (Old Dog). 10mins

[Toerless]-Not sure about the TE and DetNet relationship, but the requirements have been discussed on the control plane and data plane in DetNet WG.

[János Farkas]-DetNet is not TE technology. It can be considered as Traffic Steering, similar to CATS, which defines data plane extension, while others use existing TE technology.

3,RAW/DetNet muti-domain use cases and solution consideration. Presenter: Carlos J. Bernardos (UC3M). 10mins.

No comments.

4,Enhanced Use cases for Scaling Deterministic Networks. Presenter: Junfeng Zhao (CAICT). 10mins

No comments.

5,Deterministic QoS consideration for enhanced DetNet. Presenter: Peng Liu(China Mobile). 10mins

[Daniel Huang]-The requirement of problem No.2 is about end-to-end network and computing. The delay of edge computing is also added to the network, but currently there is no such use case in existing discussion. It requires a combination of DetNet and CATS, and it is also required for collaboration with TE.

6,Requirements and solution of scaling deterministic networking capability as a service. Presenter: Chanchan Huang(China Telecom). 10mins

[Jinoo]-I am very interested in IP3.0, did you publish the paper and can you email me?

[Cancan]-Thanks, we have IP 3.0 paper in Chinese version. 

[Daniel Huang]-I will pass to you as son as I get the English version.

7,Solution consideration about differentiated DetNet QoS and TE. Quan Xiong (ZTE). 15mins.

[Jinoo]-What is different between the aggregate and per-class scheduling?

[Daniel Huang]-Aggregate scheduling is based on the aggregated-flows and per-class is based on the traffic classification and can provide fine-grained traffic scheduling.

8,Open discussions. Daniel Huang.20mins

No discussion due to the time limits.

*****Next Step*****

1,Detailed discussion and modification about the DetNet QoS and TE, including the use cases, aggregation and per-class QoS and the fine-grained traffic and resource scheduling.

2, Ask suggestions from related WGs (e.g. DetNet, Teas, Cats and so on) and more reviews and feedbacks for the existing drafts.

3,Welcome people who are interested in QoS and TE to join and collebrate with us.Thanks!
